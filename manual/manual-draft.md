# Introduction

This manual which you hold your hands is meant to guide you through the treacherous, and often bullshitingly unfair *unamed dungeon* that shelters the *Dungeon Star*. This manual currently holds no information, but is meant to guide players who are new to the genre of roguelikes, or to provide specific information to **Dungeon Star**.
