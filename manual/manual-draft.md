# Introduction

This manual which you hold your hands is meant to guide you through the treacherous, and often bullshitingly unfair dungeon known as *The Depression* that shelters the *Dungeon Star*. This manual currently holds little useful information, but is meant to guide players who are new to the genre of roguelikes, or to provide specific information to **Dungeon Star**.

# Gameplay
The current goal of **Dungeon Star** is to reach the lowest point of the dungeon without dying, while collecting as much gold as possible. Your obstacles are the inhabitants of *The Depression*, who appear to be various creatures represented by the letters of the alphabet. To attack an enemy, attempt to walk into it. Not all enemies will be so easy to attack, so here are a few tips to deal with them:

* If you find yourself surrounded by enemies, retreat into a 1-tile wide tunnel. It will be easier to deal with one enemy at a time, instead of being assaulted on every side.
* Use items to your advantage! Many deaths can be prevented not by running-and-gunning, or racing through the dungeon as soon as possible, but by using the right item at the right time.
* Both the player and enemies can attack in all 8 directions, so if you are only using the arrow-keys to move adjacent to an enemy in the cardinal directions, they will almost certainly be able to get a hit on you.
* As long as you aren't hungry, your health will heal automatically. There's almost no reason to rush through the dungeon.

The threat of starvation is a constant threat in *The Depression*. Luckily for you, a current surplus of food stuffs caused by rampant item imbalancing means that you shouldn't face any real threat of starvation. For now. To eat food items, open the inventory with *i* and select the food item you want to eat. Sometimes, monster will drop their corpses (represented by %), and their flesh can be extracted by pressing *x*.

# Items

There are several items to be found within *The Depression* to help you on your quest to finding the *Dungeon Star*.

## Potions and Scrolls

Potions are found in the dungeon as a variety of long lost soft drink cans. When consumed, they can provide some effect to the protagonist, and provide a small amount of nutrition.

Scrolls are found labelled, and enable the user to perform some magic spell when read. However, they can only be used once, so consider the best opportunity to use them!

## Wands

Wands, like scrolls, allow the user to perform a magic spell when used. However, they have a limited number of charges, so they can be used multiple times before being depleted of energy.
